### A new game

- Add the new game html, it is easiest to copy an existing game and modify it.
- Modify the `<title>` tag and the `<h1>` tag to the name of the new game.
- Modify the patcher for the new DLL names/patches.
- Keep indentation consistent. We will have to fix your PR if it contains poor formatting, which will delay the merging process.
- Modify `index.html` to add the new game. Sorting: alphabetical by game series, then in release order per game.
